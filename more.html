                     <p>Inspired by Trevor Andrew’s love of Disney and street art culture, the collection has a relaxed feel and boasts several Disney characters, all-over prints, and Andrew’s signature symbols, such as the ghost and the flying egg. </p>

                     <hr>
                     <p>Sweatshirts, hoodies, T-shirts, shirts, and a long-sleeved polo shirt come in oversized and relaxed fits, ideal for the new season. On top of that, the drop offers must-have accessories like caps, socks, and boxer shorts. As for Andrew’s favourite collection pieces: “I love the denim because the logos make it very iconic. I also like the varsity jacket because it has several Disney characters on it. It’s fun to be able to put so many all in one piece,” says Andrew.
